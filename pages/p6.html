                            <b>The Significance of Community Service: -</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <i>“Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more.” </i><br>
                            ― H. Jackson Brown Jr.
                            <br><br>

                            Engaging in community service gives us a chance to become an active member of the community and 
                            leave a positive impact. It provides us a chance to acquire life skills and provide service to 
                            those who need it the most. This is beneficial for both us and the individuals as well the society.
                            
                            Community service can be a way for us to explore our interests and show us a possible career path. 
                            By engaging in community service, we come to discover our hidden passions and truly make a difference.

                            This can be very beneficial for the individuals. It can help in building relationship with both peers 
                            and adults this exposes us to the real world and gives us an experience as to how the world works.

                            It also gives an opportunity to apply the theoretical and academic knowledge accumulated in real 
                            life events. This prepares us for the future.

                            Lastly and most importantly it helps us develop a sense of social responsibility and form a moral 
                            virtue of always “giving back” and always staying sympathetic towards those who have less than us.

                            Jisha is a very bright girl with very bright future prospects, she is very fast to grasp concept and 
                            is very consistent during classes and is always able to complete the homework without fail. She also 
                            is very serious towards learning and approaches every subject with great gusto. She has been able to 
                            keep up with the fast pace in the class and adjusted perfectly with the situation and arrived at every class without fail. She tries her best to understand the concept and is able to immediately apply the topic to the question given to her.

                            She is also very good in academics (i.e. what can be seen with studying with her for a month). She is 
                            always curious and has reached me with doubts even after class and has been prompt to finish the 
                            exercise and worksheets given to her. Her parents were very supportive of the EOTO program and helped 
                            me to proceed with the classes smoothly.

                            <br>
                            The main objective was to complete the chapters that were already done in the prospective learner’s 
                            class and make her understand the concepts so that she has clarity in comprehending the advanced 
                            chapters. Another goal was to make her fully equipped to attempt the school examinations. Since it 
                            was also her first time encountering such a system where tests are held regularly; the third target 
                            was giving her periodic tests and making her used to the test environment.
